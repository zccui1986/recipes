Ingredients

 - 3 cups bread flour 1 
 - 1/4 cups boiling water 
 - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
 - salt and pepper to taste 
 - 1 bunch green onions, finely chopped 
 - 2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions
 1. Use a fork to mix flour and boiling water in a large bowl. Knead dough into a ball. Cover bowl with plastic wrap; let dough rest for 30 to 60 minutes.

 2. Evenly divide dough into 16 pieces. Roll each piece into a 1/4 inch thick circle. Brush each circle with oil, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon of green onions. Roll up, cigar style, and pinch open ends together to form a circle. Roll each circle flat to 1/4 inch.

 3. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet. Fry cakes until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side.
